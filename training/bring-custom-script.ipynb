    "## TensorFlow script mode training and serving\n",
    "Script mode is a training script format for TensorFlow that lets you execute any TensorFlow training script in SageMaker with minimal modification. The [SageMaker Python SDK](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk) handles transferring your script to a SageMaker training instance. On the training instance, SageMaker's native TensorFlow support sets up training-related environment variables and executes your training script. In this tutorial, we use the SageMaker Python SDK to launch a training job and deploy the trained model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Script mode supports training with a Python script, a Python module, or a shell script. In this example, we use a Python script to train a classification model on the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). In this example, we will show how easily you can train a SageMaker using TensorFlow 1.x and TensorFlow 2.0 scripts with SageMaker Python SDK. In addition, this notebook demonstrates how to perform real time inference with the [SageMaker TensorFlow Serving container](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-tensorflow-serving-container). The TensorFlow Serving container is the default inference method for script mode. For full documentation on the TensorFlow Serving container, please visit [here](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk/blob/master/src/sagemaker/tensorflow/deploying_tensorflow_serving.rst).\n",

    "Since TensorFlow package is not called in this notebook, please select `Python 3 (Data Science)` kernel to proceed."

We have modified it to handle the `model_dir` parameter passed in by SageMaker. This is an S3 path which can be used for data sharing during distributed training and checkpointing and/or model persistence. We have also added an argument-parsing function to handle processing training-related variables.\n",

    "The `sagemaker.tensorflow.TensorFlow` estimator handles locating the script mode container, uploading your script to a S3 location and creating a SageMaker training job. Let's call out a couple important parameters here:\n",
    "\n",
    "`py_version` is set to `'py3'` to indicate that we are using script mode since legacy mode supports only Python 2. Though Python 2 will be deprecated soon, you can use script mode with Python 2 by setting py_version to `py2` and `script_mode` to True.\n",
    "\n",
    "`distribution` is used to configure the distributed training setup. It's required only if you are doing distributed training either across a cluster of instances or across multiple GPUs. Here we are using parameter servers as the distributed training schema. SageMaker training jobs run on homogeneous clusters. To make parameter server more performant in the SageMaker setup, we run a parameter server on every instance in the cluster, so there is no need to specify the number of parameter servers to launch. Script mode also supports distributed training with [Horovod](https://github.com/horovod/horovod). You can find the full documentation on how to configure distributions [here](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk/tree/master/src/sagemaker/tensorflow#distributed-training).\n",
    "\n",
    "`instance_type` specify the EC2 instance used for training. You should right-size your training instance based on the size of your data, algorithm and tasks. Here we choose `ml.c5.xlarge`. You can also read more about [G4dn](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/g4/) instances, which feature NVIDIA T4 GPUs and custom Intel Cascade Lake CPUs, and are optimized for machine learning inference and small scale training. Read more on [available instance types and pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/pricing/).  \n",
    "\n",
    "`use_spot_instances`(Optional): For further cost optimization, you can leverage [managed Amazon EC2 Spot instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-managed-spot-training.html) by setting this parameter to `True`. Managed spot training can optimize the cost of training models up to 90% over on-demand instances. SageMaker manages the Spot interruptions on your behalf. You can specify which training jobs use spot instances and a stopping condition that specifies how long Amazon SageMaker waits for a job to run using Amazon EC2 Spot instances.
